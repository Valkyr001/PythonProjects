Ncrypt is a cryptographic tool for secure encryption and decryption of system files using the AES-256 symmetric encryption algorithm in CBC mode, using
IVs (Initialization Vectors) to enforce perfect forward secrecy and strengthen the algorithm against cryptanalysis attacks. Ncrypt includes an option to create
an AES-256 encrypted vault file to securely store passwords used in encryption operations to lessen the need for the end-user to remember the passwords used 
and reduce bad password storage habits.
